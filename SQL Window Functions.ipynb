    "# An Introduction to Window Functions\n",
    "In the first lesson, we’ll learn what window functions are, how they work, and the syntax of the OVER clause and its elements.\n",
    "After we finish this lesson, we’ll be able to:\n",
    "* Describe what window functions are\n",
    "* Understand different types of window functions\n",
    "* Define a window with the OVER() clause\n",
    "* Divide a window into partitions using PARTITION BY clause\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discovering Window Functions\n",
    "Until now, we've been able to answer questions about aggregating data using the `GROUP BY` clause, but sometimes we'll encounter questions in our analysis that go beyond the capabilities of GROUP BY. Here are a few examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* What's the 7-day rolling average of daily sales?\n",
    "* What's the year-to-date sales growth rate compared to the same period last year?\n",
    "* What's the difference between each employee’s salary and their department’s average salary?  \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL has a solution for handling these complex questions: window functions. Throughout this course, we'll learn how to answer questions like these and see how powerful window functions can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are similarities, significant differences exist between window functions and the `GROUP BY` clause. Let’s compare and contrast the two to help us better understand window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUP BY**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the `GROUP BY` clause to a SQL query enables us to apply aggregate functions, such as `SUM`, `MIN`, `COUNT`, or `AVG`, to groups of rows. The `GROUP BY` clause collapses the individual rows with the same value for the columns in the `GROUP BY` clause into a single row that contains summary values.\n",
    "Let’s take a look at an example to understand the concept properly. Suppose we have a table containing the capital bike share’s trip data stored in a PostgreSQL database as follows: \n",

    "## Types of Window Functions in SQL\n",
    "In response to the growing demand for powerful data analysis tools in recent years, several new window functions have been introduced to SQL databases. This trend will likely continue as data analysis becomes more complex and sophisticated, and we expect to see the development of even more advanced window functions in the future. For now, we can categorize the existing window functions in SQL supported by PostgreSQL into four groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Aggregate Functions:** We're all familiar with aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` in queries with `GROUP BY` clause. The aggregate function must operate on a set, whether a `GROUP BY` clause or a window specification defines the set. We'll discuss them in lesson 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ranking Functions:** Ranking and indexing data to figure out which rows are the best in the dataset can be done with ranking functions like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `NTILE()`. We'll discuss them in lesson 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distribution Functions:** This type of window function includes `CUME_DIST()` and `PERCENT_RANK()`, which provide information on the data distribution and are used in statistical analysis. We'll discuss them in lesson 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Offset Functions:** There are two categories of window offset functions. The first category includes the `LAG()` and `LEAD()` functions, which return a value from a specific row before and after the current row. The second category includes the `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`, and `NTH_VALUE()` functions, which respectively return a value from the first, last, and *nth* rows in the current window. We'll discuss these functions in lesson 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Window Function Syntax\n",
    "On this screen, we'll look at window function syntax and discuss its elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, SQL window functions allow us to apply various calculations to a set of rows (also called a window) related to the current row and return a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OVER` clause defines the specification of a window and involves three core elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Partitioning definition \n",
    "* Ordering definition\n",
    "* Framing definition \n",
    "\n",
    "However, depending on the function we call, some elements aren't required; even the `OVER` clause can be empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the window function call as part of a `SELECT` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "function_name([expression]) OVER \n",
    "(\n",
    "    [partition_definition]\n",
    "    [order_definition]\n",
    "    [frame_definition]\n",
    ") [AS column_name] \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick look at the elements of the window function syntax. SQL provides different types of window functions which need to appear before the `OVER()` clause. We'll learn the functions in detail in the following lessons. The `OVER()` clause determines which rows are included in a window before a window function computes a value for each row in the window. As shown in the syntax above, the `OVER()` clause supports the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `PARTITION BY` expression divides the result set into partitions, or groups, based on one or more columns. The window function is then applied to each partition separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `ORDER BY` expression determines the order in which the window function is applied. Results can be ordered in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `frame_definition` defines a frame bounded by the `partition_definition` section, so a given window function will be applied to the rows in the frame. Framing is an advanced topic we'll cover in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The OVER() Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look deeper at the `OVER()` clause on this screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the details, let's explore the `employee` table, which represents the details of a company’s employees, by running the following query in the code runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "## An Introduction to Window Framing\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we looked through the basics of window functions, the `OVER()` clause syntax, and its elements. \n",
    "We already know how to divide a window into smaller subsets using the `PARTITION BY` expression. Here's the general window function syntax we learned in the previous lesson:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about window framing, which lets us specify a window smaller than the partition. For example, with framing, we can precisely define a window that starts from the beginning of the result set and stops at the current row or define a window containing three rows before and three rows after the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "With frames, we can define a window containing exactly those rows in relation to the current row that should be considered when computing the results.\n",

    "## Window Framing Syntax\n",
    "Window framing restricts the rows in the window partition, which applies to aggregate window functions and three offset functions. We'll discuss them in the following lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Window framing defines two endpoints in relation to the current row within the partition. The calculation applies to the frame based on the given ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard SQL framing specification includes a `ROWS`, `RANGE`, or `GROUPS` option.\n",
    "To define a window frame, we can use the following syntaxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ROWS BETWEEN starting expression AND ending expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `RANGE BETWEEN starting expression AND ending expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GROUPS BETWEEN starting expression AND ending expression`\n",
    "\n",

    "The `starting expression` supports the following terms:\n",

    "In the previous lessons, we learned the basics of window functions and one of the most challenging concepts in window functions: framing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll discuss window aggregate functions. Although aggregate functions and the aggregation concept are intuitive and familiar to most database users, and we used them as go-to examples in the previous lessons, this familiarity can confuse even the most experienced SQL developers when they want to learn the aggregate window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, when we write aggregate queries, the columns not included in the `GROUP BY` clause do not appear in the result set, and we lose the details. In the example below, we lose brand and model information for the sales items because they are only aggregated on the date.\n",

    "The `OVER` clause allows us to add aggregate functions to non-aggregate and even aggregate queries and eliminate the mentioned restriction. Thus, a window aggregate function doesn’t require a `GROUP BY` clause. So we can implement more insightful queries without dealing with the limits of the `GROUP BY` clause.\n",

    "## What Are Window Aggregate Functions?\n",
    "Window aggregate functions are the same functions as grouped aggregate functions. One of the differences is how we apply these two classes of functions to a set of rows. When you use an aggregate function with a `GROUP BY` clause, you can compute one result from the group of rows in the result set. However, the window aggregate functions are calculated over a range of rows defined by an `OVER()` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference lies in the output: while grouping gives us results per group, with `OVER()`, we get results for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discover the difference between them with an example. \n",

    "## Window Functions and the Order of Execution\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's discover the query processing order since it is one of the most fundamental aspects of SQL that every SQL developer needs to learn, especially when dealing with window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always keep in mind the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `FROM` and `JOIN`: The `FROM` clause constructs the data set for the query. Multiple data sources can be joined using the `JOIN` clause if necessary.\n",
    "2. `WHERE`: The conditions defined in the `WHERE` clause determine which rows are included in the data set.\n",
    "3. `GROUP BY`: The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data set's rows based on the grouping expression. \n",
    "4. `HAVING`: The `HAVING` clause filters aggregate results.\n",
    "5. `SELECT`: The `SELECT` clause determines those columns appearing in the result set.\n",
    "   * This is where we've been using window functions.\n",
    "6. `ORDER BY`:  The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set based on one or multiple columns.\n",
    "7. `OFFSET`: The `OFFSET` clause determines where to start returning data.\n",
    "8. `LIMIT`: The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can put aggregate functions in a `HAVING` clause, given the above, it's impossible to put window aggregate functions in the `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses because while these clauses are being processed, we haven't gotten to `SELECT` yet. Thus the results of the window functions still aren't ready for consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Write a query against the `employees` table that returns the `first_name`, `last_name`, `department`, and `salary` columns along with the average salary of the department they are associated with, aliased as `dep_avg_salary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sort the result set based on the department's average salary in descending order.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT first_name, last_name, department, salary,\n",
    "       AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY department) AS dep_avg_salary\n",

    "## Combining Window Aggregate Functions with Aggregate Queries\n",
    "Combining window aggregates with aggregate queries is more complex than it seems. Let's look deeper into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we're asked to report the total salary for each department and company's total salary based on the data in the `employees` table. \n",
    "\n",
    "To respond to the question, we can try the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_depatment_salary,\n",
    "       SUM(salary) OVER() AS total_company_salary\n",
    "  FROM employees\n",
    " GROUP BY department; \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Yes, it shows the error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ERROR: column \"employees.salary\" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the issue above, we should keep in mind these two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The result of the `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses determines the rows and columns in the base window and the granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Any expression used anywhere in the window function must be in the `GROUP BY` clause or aggregated inside the window function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the mentioned rules, the rows in the window are created after the `GROUP BY` operation; therefore, the window contains any expression listed in the `GROUP BY` clause plus any aggregate expression. Any expression in any part of window functions must follow the same rules as the `SELECT` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above explanation means that since the `department` column is part of the `GROUP BY` clause, we can use the column as the argument of any window functions or as a `PARTITION BY` column. Also, to use the `salary` column in any window functions, it must be aggregated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, SUM(salary) as total_depatment_salary,\n",
    "       SUM(SUM(salary)) OVER() as total_company_salary\n",

    "# Ranking Window Functions\n",
    "This lesson provides an introduction to the `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `NTILE()` functions to generate ranking within a window. It also provides a practical, hands-on approach to using the ranking window function to solve complex analytical problems.\n",
    "* Explain the purpose and benefits of using ranking window functions in SQL\n",
    "* Describe the syntax and parameters of each ranking function\n",
    "* Understand the differences between ranking window functions to choose the appropriate ranking function\n",
    "* Use ranking window functions to solve complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Ranking Window Functions\n",
    "SQL window functions have evolved the ability to gain insights from the underlying data, and undoubtedly, ranking window functions play a significant role among them. Ranking window functions rank rows within a specified partition of a result set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about ranking window functions and how to use them in SQL.\n",
    "Ranking functions are nondeterministic functions gathered under the window functions umbrella and designed to solve complicated problems quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, ranking window functions enable us to answer which observation is best, second best, or worst, which is hard to implement this kind of queries with conventional SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're going to learn the following four ranking functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ROW_NUMBER()`\n",
    "* `RANK()`\n",
    "* `DENSE_RANK()`\n",
    "* `NTILE()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three functions assign a sequential number to each row in a query’s result set. The last function creates a specified number of buckets (or groups) and gives each row in a query’s result set to one of these buckets according to their rank, starting with one and continuing to the number of buckets specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will discuss these ranking functions in detail. After we finish this lesson, we'll have a good understanding of\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to use the ranking window functions to create a basis for solving analytics problems.\n",
    "* The difference between the `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` functions.\n",
    "* How to define a specified number of buckets with the `NTILE()` function to solve particular analytical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ranking Functions and Supported Windowing Elements\n",
    "Before explaining the four ranking window functions in detail and delving further into the hands-on practice, let’s review which windowing elements are mandatory or optional when calling the ranking functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dq-authoring-tmp-data/775-909/2.1-m775.svg\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, all four ranking functions support the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An optional `PARTITION BY` subclause. The query's result set is considered a single partition if we don't specify a window partition clause.\n",
    "* An `ORDER BY` subclause, which is not mandatory but strongly encouraged for meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Window framing is irrelevant to the ranking window functions. The functions are always applied to the entire partition, as ranking is always relative to other rows within the same partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these three windowing elements, the `ORDER BY` subclause is much more important when using the ranking window functions. Unlike aggregate window functions, where the `ORDER BY` subclause is only used for framing purposes, in the ranking window functions, this strongly-encouraged subclause is used for determining the rank and giving meaning to the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the syntax of the ranking functions in the simplest form is as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "RANKING_FUNCTION() OVER(\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\tORDER BY column_name\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t   )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()`functions do not take arguments. However, empty parentheses are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ROW_NUMBER() Function\n",
    "Let’s learn the ranking window function with the most commonly used window function for data analysis, `ROW_NUMBER()`. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function returns a unique integer starting with one for each row within the respective window partition, sorted based on the specified window ordering expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the ranking function is as follows:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n",
    "    [PARTITION BY expression,...]\n",
    "    ORDER BY expression,...  \n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous screen, the window partitioning element is optional, and the window ordering element is necessary for meaningful, reproducible results. So, remember that we have to always include the `ORDER BY` subclause inside the `OVER()` clause when we call the ranking window functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the modified version of the capital bike share’s trip dataset called `trips`.\n",
    "The `trips` table’s rows represent twelve bike trips with all the associated information we’ve seen in lesson one, plus the `rider_rating` column, which indicates how satisfied the rider is with riding the bike.\n",
    "To understand how the `ROW_NUMBER()` function works, let’s apply it to the `trips` table and see the result.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    " SELECT start_date, bike_number, member_type, rider_rating,\n",
    "       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY rider_rating)\n",
    "  FROM trips;\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we learned the four ranking window functions in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ROW_NUMBER()`  is the simplest of the ranking window functions. It assigns a unique number to each row within a specified partition of a result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `RANK()` assigns a ranking to each row within a result set based on the values of a specified column or expression, indicating its rank relative to the other rows in the result set. If two or more rows have the same value for the ranking column or expression, they'll be assigned the same rank value, and the next rank value will be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DENSE_RANK()` is similar to the `RANK()` function. Unlike the `RANK()` function, `DENSE_RANK()` does not skip rank values when there are ties in the data. This means that if two or more rows have the same value for the ranking column or expression, they'll be assigned the same rank value, and the next rank value will be assigned to the subsequent row(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NTILE()`  divides a result set into a specified number of equal groups, buckets, or tiles based on a specified column or expression. The `NTILE()` function assigns a unique integer value to each row, indicating which tile the row belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed how the above functions work, and their difference has been highlighted. \n",
    "We also learned how we could use these functions for solving analytical problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "##  Introduction to Offset Window Functions\n",
    "In the previous lessons, we’ve seen how window functions have revolutionized how we query and analyze data. \n",
    "Offset window functions provide access to individual rows within a partition and can be divided into two types: one type points to another row based on the current row, while the other type points to a row based on an absolute position, regardless of the current row.  \n",
    "To understand better the difference between the two types of offset window functions, imagine that you have just arrived at a downtown hotel and are in the mood for a cup of coffee. You decide to go out and look for the closest Starbucks. As you are walking, you come across a guy and ask him for the address of the nearest Starbucks. He could respond in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By giving directions to a place based on your current location. For example, he might say, \"There's a really good Starbucks, just two stores to the north of where we are right now.\" In this case, the directions are **relative** to your current location. \n",
    "2. By giving directions to a place based on a fixed reference point, like a street or landmark. For example, he might say, \"There's an awesome Starbucks at the corner of 6th and Spring Street.\" In this case, the directions are  **independent** of where you're currently located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offset window functions support both types of directions, relative and absolute:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `LEAD()` and `LAG()` functions come under the **relative** category since they use the positional offset from the current row.\n",
    "* The `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`, and `NTH_VALUE()` functions belong to the **absolute** category since they use an offset from the frame boundaries, making them **independent** of the current row's position.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will demonstrate how these functions allow you to efficiently include any columns from other rows in your query results without requiring a self-join.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we'll discuss how offset window functions can be used to solve real-world problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After you finish this lesson, you'll have a good understanding of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The definition and categories of offset window functions\n",
    "* The syntax and usage of offset window functions  \n",
    "* How to solve real-world problems using offset window functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The LEAD() Function\n",
    "The first offset window function we'll discuss is `LEAD()`. The `LEAD()` function returns the values for a row at a specified offset below the current row in the window partition. The default offset is 1 if not specified.\n",
    "Let’s look at the function syntax before examining it in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dq-authoring-tmp-data/776-909/2.1-m776.svg\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "LEAD (expression, offset, default_value) \n",
    "OVER (\n",
    "    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]\n",
    "    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `expression`: The column or expression on which the `LEAD()` function operates.\n",
    "* `offset` (optional): A positive integer that defines the number of rows forward from the current row.\n",
    "* `default_value` (optional): the value to return if the next row does not exist. The default is `NULL`.\n",
    "* ‍`PARTITION BY‍`: an optional subclause that divides the result set into partitions based on the values of one or more columns or expressions.\n",
    "* `ORDER BY`: A mandatory subclause that specifies the column or expression used to sort the rows within each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LEAD()` function returns the column value in the row that follows the current row by the specified offset. If no such row exists, the function returns the default value, `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that while the `PARTITION BY` subclause is optional — enclosed in square brackets — the `ORDER BY` subclause is crucial in determining the sequence of rows in the partition. It specifies the column or expression used to order the rows, making it possible to identify the previous and next rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the `LEAD()` function, which is designed to access specific rows at a fixed offset from the current row, framing cannot be implemented in the window function. The same applies to the `LAG()` function, which we'll discuss on the next screen, as it also focuses on accessing rows at a set distance from the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the first five rows of the following table, `phone_sales_quantity_by_month`, containing the sales data for six months of 2022 for two brands, Samsung and Apple. The number of phone sales for each brand is given in the `quantity` column for each sales date specified in the `sales_date` column.\n",

    "In the previous section, we covered the `LEAD()` and `LAG()` offset window functions, which allow us to include any column from a given number of rows away from the current row. Since these functions are relative to the current row, they're also called row offset window functions.\n",

    "In contrast, the `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`, and `NTH_VALUE()` functions are not dependent on the current row and allow us to include any column from the first, last, or nth row of the partition. These functions are also called frame offset window functions because they specify the offset with respect to the beginning or end of the window, and framing becomes relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with the `FIRST_VALUE()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dq-authoring-tmp-data/776-909/4.1-m776_v2.svg\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FIRST_VALUE()` function retrieves the value of the first row within a partition.\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax of the function:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "FIRST_VALUE (expression)\n",
    "OVER (\n",
    "    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]\n",
    "    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...\n",
    "    [framing_clause]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we've already discussed the general syntax of the offset window functions, let's shift our focus to the last part of the syntax above, `[framing_clause]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LEAD()` and `LAG()` functions support window partitioning and ordering, but not window framing. This is reasonable since the offset is relative to the current row. When using the `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()` functions, window framing comes into play because the offset is relative to the start and end of the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rely on the default framing when using the `FIRST_VALUE()` function. As we discussed in the *Window Function Framing lesson* when we don't explicitly indicate a window frame clause, the default framing is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the `FIRST_VALUE()` function returns the first row of the partition with the default window framing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While relying on the default framing makes sense, and the `FIRST_VALUE()` function returns a correct result, using `ROWS` instead of `RANGE` is more efficient for the database server's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll explore how the `FIRST_VALUE` function works in practice. \n",

    "* Offset window functions retrieve values from rows before or after the current row or from the first or last row in the window frame. The syntax of these functions is similar, but the specific parameters may differ depending on the function.\n",
    "* As the `ORDER BY` subclause determines the order in which the rows are processed in the window, it is crucial for the offset window functions to work correctly.\n",
    "* Partitioning the data into groups with the `PARTITION BY` subclause is optional; however, it becomes essential when using offset window functions to perform calculations within the groups. It allows us to apply the same function to each group separately.\n",

    "The last lesson of the SQL window functions course delves into distribution or statistical window functions, which provide insights into data distribution and are used chiefly for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution window functions have diverse applications across various domains, including marketing, finance, healthcare, sports, and education. They allow data analysts to gain valuable insights from data and make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "For example, these functions can help marketers identify the top-performing products, campaigns, or customers based on their sales or engagement metrics, allowing them to optimize their marketing strategy. Also, they can be used for calculating the percentiles of medical data such as blood pressure, BMI, or cholesterol levels, helping physicians or researchers diagnose diseases or assess the health status of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover two types of distribution window functions:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CUME_DIST()`\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. Inverse distribution functions are used to calculate the value at a specified percentile in a group based on the ordering specified in the `WITHIN GROUP()` clause.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Rank Distribution Functions - CUME_DIST()\n",
    "As mentioned, two variants of rank distribution functions exist: `CUME_DIST()` and `PERCENT_RANK()`. They compute a row's relative rank in the window partition and return a ratio between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rank distribution function that we'll discuss is `CUME_DIST()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `CUME_DIST()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CUME_DIST()` function, which takes no argument, calculates the cumulative distribution of values in a column specified in the `ORDER BY` subclause. In other words, assuming the data is sorted in ascending order, the cumulative distribution of a value in a particular row is determined as the number of rows with values less than or equal to that value divided by the number of rows existing in the window partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the `CUME_DIST()` function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "CUME_DIST() OVER ( [PARTITION BY expression, ... ]\n",
    "                   ORDER BY expression [ASC | DESC], ... )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‍`PARTITION BY‍`: an optional subclause that divides the result set into partitions based on the values of one or more columns or expressions.\n",
    "* `ORDER BY`: a mandatory subclause that specifies the column or expression used to sort the rows within each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how the function works.\n",

    "\n",
    "Write a query against the `tbl_bikeshare` table to select the fast riders for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a CTE called \"fast_rides\" that performs the following steps:\n",
    "   * Select the `start_date`, `duration`, and `bike_number` columns.\n",
    "   * Use the `EXTRACT` function to pull the day from the `start_date` column.\n",
    "   * Calculate the cumulative distribution of trip durations for each day using the `CUME_DIST()` window function, partitioned by day and ordered by duration in descending order.\n",
    "   * Use a `CASE` statement to assign the label 'Fast Rider' to the riders whose trips' durations fall in the top 5% (i.e., have a cumulative distribution greater than or equal to 0.95). Alias this new column as `fast_riders`.\n",
    "2. In the main query, select all columns from the \"fast_rides\" CTE.\n",

    "We already discussed rank distribution functions in the previous section, which compute the relative rank of the current row in the window partition and return a ratio between 0 and 1 that can be expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100. \n",
    "\n",

    "- - -\n",

    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation is a statistical method that estimates a value within a range of known values in a given dataset and inserts it between two existing values. \n",
    "- - -\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's elaborate on the theoretical concept with an example.\n",
    "Consider the following list of sorted values:\n",
    "`1, 4, 5, 41, 100, 2100, 79000`\n",
    "The fiftieth percentile or the *median* of the given values is 41. \n",
    "Since the set has seven values, the median falls at the fourth rank, which means that 50% of the values are below rank four, and 50% are above rank four.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if a sorted list contains even values?\n",
    "In this case, the median will be an interpolated value between the two middle values.\n",

    "\n",
    "`1, 4, 5, 41, 100, 2100`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have six values, so we can't just take the value in the middle of the list as the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the median in this case, we need to take the average of the two middle values. The middle two values in this case are 5 and 41, so we add them together and divide by two to get (5 + 41) / 2 = 23. So the median of this list is 23, which is an interpolated value between the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on from the theoretical discussion and discover how SQL helps us to perform such valuable calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the two inverse distribution functions, let's discuss a new SQL clause, `WITHIN GROUP`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- - -\n",
    "\n",
    "Rank distribution functions are window functions that assign a different percentile rank to each row in a window partition. However, since inverse distribution functions require a specified percentile as an input, an ordering specification within a group, and returning a single result per group, they are used as grouped functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the `WITHIN GROUP` clause is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the PostgreSQL documentation, the two functions belong to a group of functions called [Ordered-Set Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-ORDEREDSET-TABLE), and the syntax is as follows:\n",

This means that, unlike window functions, we can use these two functions in the WHERE clause of an SQL query, but we must use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to perform the calculation first, then reference the result in the WHERE clause.\n",

    "* There are two types of distribution window functions in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rank distribution functions** are used to calculate the relative rank of a specific row in a window partition based on the ordering specified in the `OVER()` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `PERCENT_RANK()` calculates the relative rank of a specific row within a window partition as a percentage value between 0 and 1, with 0 representing the first row and 1 representing the last row in the partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CUME_DIST()` computes the cumulative distribution of a specific row within a window partition, which is the proportion of rows with values less than or equal to the current row's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. **Inverse distribution functions** are used to calculate the value at a specified percentile in a group based on the ordering specified in the `WITHIN GROUP()` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `PERCENTILE_CONT()` is a continuous inverse distribution function that calculates the value at a specified percentile within a group using linear interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PERCENTILE_DISC()` is a discrete inverse distribution function that finds the value at a specified percentile within a group, returning the first value with a cumulative distribution greater than or equal to the specified percentile.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `WITHIN GROUP` is a clause used to specify an ordering expression for aggregate and analytic functions, allowing them to operate on sorted rows within a group instead of the unsorted rows created by the `GROUP BY` clause. It is particularly useful for inverse distribution functions, which require an ordering specification within a group and return a single result per group, such as `PERCENTILE_CONT()` and `PERCENTILE_DISC()`.\n",
